    <p>Here is my favorite gingerbread cookies recipe and one of the most popular Christmas cookie recipes on this website.</p>
    <p>Soft in the centers, crisp on the edges, perfectly spiced, molasses and brown sugar-sweetened holiday goodness. </p>

    <div class="list">
    <ul>    
        <li>Molasses + spices for flavor</li>
        <li>Egg so the gingerbread cookies have structure and richness</li>
        <li>Brown sugar instead of white granulated sugar. I always use brown sugar when its flavor fits.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Chill the dough: The dough is sticky once it's all beaten together in your mixing bowl and therefore, it absolutely MUST be chilled for at least 3 hours. Give yourself enough time in the kitchen or make the cookie dough and chill it overnight. You want your cookie dough firm so the cookies hold their shape and you want your cookie dough manageable so you can work with it. You won't have either unless you have chilled cookie dough!</li>
        <li>Wrap up the dough: It's easiest to wrap the dough in plastic wrap before chilling. Scoop out 1/2 of the prepared cookie dough, plop it onto a long sheet of plastic wrap, wrap it up, and flatten it out into a disc. Repeat with the other 1/2 of dough. Then chill. See that photo above? That's what you're doing, but you'll have 2 discs. Why are you doing this? It's easier to roll out the chilled cookie dough when it is in a disc shape. Also, the cookie dough chills faster when there is less volume. And it's just easier to work with smaller portions when rolling/shaping!</li>
        <li>Roll it out: After chilling, roll out the chilled cookie dough discs until about 1/4-inch thick. Don't be afraid to flour your hands, rolling pin, work surface, and everything in the world. By that, I mean: the cookie dough can become sticky as you work. So, don't be scared to add more flour to the work surface. The flour spots on top of your shaped cookie dough will bake off.</li>
    </ol>
