    <div class="paragraph">

    <p>Around Christmastime, you will find rabanada popping up in many Brazilian homes. </p>
    <p>This deliciously indulgent version of French toast is a Christmas staple for good reason! </p>

    <div class="list">
        <ul> 
            <li>¼ c sugar</li>
            <li> Tbsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>3 c milk</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 loaf, stale French bread, Italian bread, brioche, or challah, sliced 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>Oil for frying, (olive or canola)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>On a large plate, mix the sugar and cinnamon until blended, set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the milk in one shallow bowl and the eggs in another. Lightly beat the eggs.</li>
            <li>In a medium skillet, heat ½ inch of oil to just before it begins to smoke (350-375F).</li>
            <li>Working with a few slices at a time, dip the bread in the milk letting it soak in. Then, dip the bread in the beaten egg, coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Place the soaked bread in the hot oil and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Carefully remove the fried French toast from the hot oil and place on a platter that has been lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Continue with the remaining bread.</li>
            <li>While the fried French toast is still warm, dip both sides in the plate with cinnamon sugar, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
